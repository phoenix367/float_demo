# Float Demo

A simple demonstration of floating-point arithmetic and its unique behaviors, aimed at exploring the quirks and edge cases of floating-point calculations in C++.

## Features

- **Floating-Point Operations**: Demonstrates common pitfalls and hacks involving floating-point arithmetic.
- **Educational**: Aims to provide insights into how floating-point numbers work in programming.
- **Lightweight**: Simple codebase to facilitate understanding and experimentation.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- Basic understanding of floating-point arithmetic.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phoenix367/float_demo.git
cd float_demo
git checkout dev
```

### Build instructions

- Open the solution file ``float_demo.sln`` in Visual Studio (or use a compatible IDE).
- Build the project.
- Run the executable to explore the floating-point demonstrations.

### Example usage
The project includes sample cases that highlight floating-point behaviors such as:

- Precision errors.
- Rounding anomalies.
- Overflow and underflow scenarios.

Run the program to see these behaviors and modify the source code to experiment with your own examples.
